- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

In this project, I learned how to store data in local storage. User stories were pretty straight forward until I came across with the issue of keeping track of the state wether which tab are you on. Took me some time to figure it out but it was a good experience to get a better understanding of lifecycle components and the works of React behind the scene while I'm trying to debug the issues.
