## Overview

- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

I'm excited about this project because I get to test myself on how good my understanding is with React. Like I said in the previous project this is just a continuation of it - adding the input component. I can only imagine how cumbersome the code would be using plain JavaScript, but with React managing state and reusing components has been easy. I think that if there was to improve based on my experience here, it would be better coding structure and taking advantage of different data structure. Sometimes when I code I wouldn't think how a component or a particular function can be reusable for later use. With that, code change is inevitable and its a waste of time during development which I think is important in the real world.
