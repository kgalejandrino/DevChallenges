- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

It took me a couple of days to finished this project and one that I noticed is that I always get stuck where should I manage my state and what states are needed. With that, I realized how important planning is before moving into development. It also shows how knowing React hooks can be of advantage when making bigger projects because it allows you to encapsulate logic without affecting the heirarchy of components. Despite only knowing the basics of hooks, it helps me to have a cleaner code and avoid writing lots of classes. Overall, I'm happy with what I've accomplished here with a such less experience.
