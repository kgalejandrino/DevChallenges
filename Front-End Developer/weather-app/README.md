- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

My experience was great building this project because I felt like I have improved and I'm happy about it. Just like I mentioned before, and up until now I still struggled at the early stage of the development thinking of how to provide a better coding structure. I just think that my code and states can be minimize and I hoping that I will improved in that area in my future projects.
