- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

Although this project is to create our own portfolio, I decided to complete it exactly as the given design. I will be making my own portfolio soon and I just wanted to challenge myself on this one because it seems to have a very complex layout. Overall, building this project has helped me improved and get to have a better understanding between CSS grids and flexbox.
