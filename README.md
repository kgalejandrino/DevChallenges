- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

My overall experience on this project was challenging and rewarding. In the process, I struggled with the image to be responsive when scaling to different screen sizes. I used to work with pixels most of the time, and I realize that it gives more work when working with media queries. With that, I learned to take advantage of using min/max of height/width and percentages(%) and it makes coding responsive designs easier. I believed that it reduces the effort of writing another code for responsive design.
