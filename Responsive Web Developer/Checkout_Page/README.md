- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

I think that the challenges I faced when building the project was remembering the basic syntax of HTML & JS. For instance, I never work with forms a lot so I had to review during development. Note: For the sake of fulfilling the user stories, my focus is getting the UI right and for the website to be responsive. With that, it may not have the most efficient JS code.
